In this project, the solubility of organic molecules is predicted using various Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Networks, starting from a set of molecular physicochemical descriptors (obtained with RDKit) as the feature space and solubility data as the targets. The performance of these models is compared with experimental values obtained in the laboratory to evaluate which model is more efficient at predicting the solubility of the molecules in an aqueous medium.
